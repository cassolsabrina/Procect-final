    "text": "Ceratocystis wilt, caused by Ceratocystis fimbriata, was first reported in 2010 causing disease in kiwifruit vines, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (Sonego et al. 2010). The disease symptoms include wilt, dark-brown lesions in the xylem, reduced fruit size and eventual death of infected vines (Piveta et al. 2016, Ferreira et al. 2017). Currently, Ceratocystis wilt occurs in the main kiwifruit producing areas in Brazil where it severely limits the expansion of kiwifruit cultivation (Piveta et al. 2016, Ferreira et al. 2017). Additionally, the disease is a threat to the world’s largest kiwifruit-producing countries, such as China, Italy, Iran, Greece, Chile and New Zealand, where the disease has not been reported yet on kiwifruit."

    "text": "In kiwifruit vines, the Ceratocystis fimbriata infection generally initiates through the roots, but pruning wounds can also serve as an entry point for the pathogen. For this reason, disinfestation of pruning tools and equipment becomes important, since the pathogen can spread from diseased to healthy plants through infested pruning tools. Additionally, protection of fresh pruning wounds with the application of fungicides or other protective barriers, can potentially be an effective control strategy against C. fimbriata if incorporated into integrated disease management. However, chemical control of C. fimbriata on kiwifruit vines remains poorly studied, and no fungicides have been registered for this pathosystem yet."

Commercial products were suspended in autoclaved distilled water to obtain stock solutions (2000 μg a.i. mL) and the appropriate volume was added to PDA, to obtain the different concentrations. The C. fimbriata isolates were grown in PDA medium, at 28◦C and 12 h photoperiod, for twelve days. After incubation, mycelial plugs (6 mm diameter) were taken from the margin of the colonies, for each C. fimbriata isolate and placed in the center of Petri dishes (60 mm diameter) containing PDA amended with the fungicides. Mycelial growth was evaluated after approximately seven days of incubation, at 25 ºC and 12 h photoperiod, until one of the colonies reached the border of the plate. The colony diameter was measured in two perpendicular directions and the mycelial growth was calculated, as shown in the figure below.\nFor each treatment (C. fimbriata isolate × fungicide × dose), four replicates (plates) were used, and the experiment was repeated once. Additionally, for those fungicides that inhibited 100% the mycelial growth, the fungistatic or fungicide effect was evaluated by transferring the mycelial plugs to a new plate, containing PDA, and incubated at 25 ºC and 12 h photoperiod for seven days. After incubation, the mycelial growth was evaluated, and for the isolates that did not grow in pure PDA, a fungicidal effect was considered and for the isolates that grew the effect was fungistatic."

For this, the shoot apex of the kiwifruit vines was pruned and each fungicide solution at 250 mg active ingredient (a.i.). L-1 was sprayed, in a volume sufficient to obtain thorough vine coverage, using a manual pressure regulated sprayer. After 1 h, 500 µL of inoculum suspension of C. fimbriata (LPF1443) at 1.0 x 107 spores/mL was applied on pruned shoot apex of each vine. A swab of moistened cotton was placed in the inoculation site and the treated plants were incubated in a greenhouse (28 ± 5 °C), with regular irrigation. Two references were adopted for comparison: 1) non-inoculated control: pruned vines sprayed with distilled autoclaved water; and inoculation control: pruned vines sprayed with distilled autoclaved water and inoculated, as shown in the figure below.\n\nA completely randomized design with five replicate plants per treatment and controls was used. At 45 days of inoculation, the disease incidence (number of infected vines divided by the number of inoculated vines and expressed as percentage) and lesion length (cm), in the inner stem tissues, were measured. The infection by C. fimbriata was confirmed using carrot baits, prepared with stem tissue samples from the evaluated plants. The experiment was repeated once."
